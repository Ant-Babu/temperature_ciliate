## Abstract
Ciliates, especially Tetrahymena Thermophila, play a crucial role in microbial food webs, impacting organic matter cycling. This repository contains a scientific article investigating temperature-driven dynamics in ciliate feeding patterns and their implications for microbial ecosystems. Methods include cell counting, phagocytosis analysis, and swimming speed measurement. The results show a strong correlation between temperature and vacuole formation in T. Thermophila, indicating potential shifts in microbial food webs with changing temperatures.
